# Time-series-forecasting

Aim:

Objectives:


Dataset analysis:

Goals:
* Find good quality dataset
* Check the reliability of dataset
* To train and apply ARIMA model on time series data
* Analyse the performance on dataset
* To show the error between the predicted and actual value
* Show spike in error values diring covid period, i.e. failure of model for crisis situations
* To improve results in crisis timespan
* To be able to use LSTM
